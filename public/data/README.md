# Data Directory

This directory contains the visualization data for the application.

The data files are **not included in the source repository** to keep it lightweight.
Instead, they are generated or downloaded separately.

## How to get the data

### Option 1: Download from the deployed site (Recommended)

You can download the full dataset from the official website using the provided script:

```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
pip install requests

# Run the download script
python scripts/download_data.py
```

This will fetch the latest data from `https://animatedllm.github.io` and place it in this directory.

### Option 2: Generate data locally

If you want to generate the data yourself (e.g., to test new models or prompts), refer to the instructions in `scripts/data-generation/README_generate.md`.

## Directory Structure

```
data/
├── inference/           # Inference examples
│   ├── examples.json   # Index file for inference examples
│   ├── en/             # English examples
│   ├── cs/             # Czech examples
│   ├── fr/             # French examples
│   └── ...             # Other languages
│
└── training/           # Training examples
    ├── examples.json   # Index file for training examples
    ├── en/             # English examples (if applicable)
    └── ...             # Other languages
```

## File Types

### Inference Examples

- Generated by `generate_data.sh`
- Uses `llm_inference_server.py` and `llm_inference_client.py`
- Files are organized by language and variant (greedy, sampling, random)
- Example: `data/inference/en/en-001-greedy.json`

### Training Examples

- Generated by `generate_training_data.sh`
- Uses `llm_training_server.py` and `llm_training_client.py`
- Files are organized by language and type (full, limited)
- Example: `data/training/en/en-001-full.json`

## Index Files

Each subdirectory (`inference/` and `training/`) has its own `examples.json` file that serves as an index:

- Lists all available examples in that subdirectory
- Contains metadata (language, model, parameters, etc.)
- Automatically generated by `create_examples_index.py`

## Generating Examples

### Inference

```bash
bash generate_data.sh
```

### Training

```bash
bash generate_training_data.sh
```
